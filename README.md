## Features
1. **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from newspaper images using Tesseract OCR.
2. **Text Cleaning**: Removes unnecessary characters and spaces.
3. **Summarization**: Summarizes the extracted text using the Sumy library.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the summarized text using NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
5. **Keyword Extraction**: Extracts top keywords using CountVectorizer.
6. **Military Flair**: Adds a military-style intro and outro to the summarized text.
7. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the final text into an audio file using pyttsx3.

## Installation
